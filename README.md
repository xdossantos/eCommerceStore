# eCommerceStore
A basic eCommerce store

○ A clear, short, and to the point description of your project. Describe
the importance of your project, and what it does.

I challenged myself to build a store where customers can conduct purchases from the comfort of thier own homes. The inventory includes food products from a fake store. This product is for self development purposes. 

○ A table of Contents to allow other people to quickly navigate
especially long or detailed READMEs.

○ An installation section which tells other users how to install your
project locally.

Installation 

Simply clone the project to your local repository and click the index.html file located in the root folder. All files are static. This project requires no opinionated envoronments to run, only an internet connection for any access to CDNs.
